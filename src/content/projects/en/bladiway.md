## Project Overview
Bladiway is a modern carpooling platform designed to promote sustainable and intelligent mobility. It connects drivers and passengers through a secure, intuitive mobile experience while providing administrators with powerful tools to manage the platform.

## The ecosystem
The solution consists of two main components:
1.  **Mobile App (Flutter):** A cross-platform app (iOS/Android) for end-users to book rides, publish trips, and communicate.
2.  **Admin Dashboard (React):** A web-based control panel for user verification, complaint handling, and analytics.

## Technical Approach

### 1. Mobile Application (Flutter)
-   **State Management:** Utilized **Provider** for efficient state handling across the app.
-   **Backend & Auth:** Built on **Firebase** (Authentication, Firestore, Storage) for real-time data syncing and secure user management.
-   **Maps & Location:** Integrated **Google Maps SDK** and **Geolocator** for precise pickup/drop-off selection and route visualization.
-   **Communication:** Implemented specific features for real-time messaging and push notifications using **Firebase Cloud Messaging**.
-   **Localization:** Fully multilingual support (French, English, Arabic, Tamazight) via **Easy Localization**.

### 2. Admin Dashboard (React)
-   **Framework:** Built with **React.js** for a responsive and dynamic user interface.
-   **Management Features:** customized interfaces for validating identity documents, monitoring reported issues, and viewing platform statistics (recharts).

## Key Features
-   🔐 **Secure Authentication:** Identity verification to build community trust.
-   🚗 **Ride Management:** Seamless booking, publishing, and cancellation flows.
-   💬 **In-App Chat:** Instant communication between driver and passenger.
-   🔔 **Real-time Notifications:** Updates on booking status and messages.
-   ⭐ **Rating System:** User feedback to ensure quality service.
