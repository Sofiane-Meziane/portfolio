## Summary
Real-time driver vigilance monitoring with a webcam. The system measures eye openness and blink behavior, then uses fuzzy logic to assess fatigue and display recommendations.

## Problem
Reduce fatigue-related driving risk by detecting reduced vigilance and guiding the driver to take a break.

## Approach
- Captures video with OpenCV and detects facial landmarks via MediaPipe.
- Computes EAR (eye aspect ratio), blink frequency, and slow blinks.
- Applies fuzzy inference rules to output a 0-100 vigilance score with clear messages.

## Results
The system provides four vigilance states with recommended actions, from normal driving to immediate stop.
