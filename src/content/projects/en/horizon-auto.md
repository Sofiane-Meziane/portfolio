## Project Overview
Horizon Auto is a comprehensive desktop software designed to digitize and automate the internal processes of a driving school. Built with a strict **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture, it provides secure, role-specific environments to manage every aspect of the school's operations, from student registration to fleet maintenance.

## The Solution
The application maps the real-world structure of the business into three distinct workspaces:
1.  **Administrator Space:** For total control over resources (Staff, Vehicles).
2.  **Secretary Space:** For operational management (Planning, Registrations).
3.  **Instructor Space:** For educational tracking (Student Progress, Grading).

## Technical Approach
-   **Core Engine:** Developed in **Java** with **JavaFX** for a modern, responsive user interface.
-   **Architecture:** Implements the **MVC Pattern** to separate business logic, data models, and UI views, ensuring code maintainability.
-   **Persistence:** Utilizes **MySQL** for robust data storage and retrieval.
-   **Environment:** Optimized for deployment via **NetBeans**.
